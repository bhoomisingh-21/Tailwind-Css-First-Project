# Tailwind CSS First Project

Welcome to my first Tailwind CSS project! This is a simple web project where I explore the utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS, to design and create beautiful and responsive layouts. As this is my first time using Tailwind, I wanted to create a simple project that would allow me to dive into the framework and learn more about its utility classes while building a responsive design.

Throughout this project, I focused on understanding how to use Tailwind's classes effectively to create layouts that adapt well across different screen sizes. This project helped me get comfortable with applying Tailwind's utility classes for spacing, typography, colors, and more.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts smoothly across various screen sizes, thanks to Tailwind's responsive utilities.
- **Modern UI**: A clean, minimal, and modern design approach, utilizing Tailwind's utility classes to achieve a polished look.
- **Custom Styling**: Tailwind's utility-first approach was used alongside customizations to make the design unique and fit my learning goals.
- **Utility-First**: This project was built entirely with Tailwind's utility classes, which allowed for rapid design and development without writing custom CSS.

## Tools Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: For the utility-first CSS framework that enables responsive and customizable design.
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
